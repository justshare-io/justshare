## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/) â€” 1.18 or later
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - 3.9 or later

{{< details "Why Go?" >}}
Go is a very easy language to learn. It's also very fast, efficient, and easy to scale.
{{< /details >}}
{{< details "Why Python?" >}}
Python is ubiquitous in ML. There is a Python service which serves as a bridge between the Go backend and the ML models.

### Start the Python service

There is a Python service which serves as a bridge between the Go backend and the ML models. It is required to run the backend.
The code is currently a work in progress, but you can find the latest details [here](https://github.com/lunabrain-ai/lunabrain/tree/main/python).

```bash
cd python
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start.py
```
